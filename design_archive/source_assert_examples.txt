SOURCES
------------------------------------------------------
Some records may constitute genealogical data in the lack of association
with place and date, for example the record that two individuals were man
and wife, or that one individual was the child of another

07-10-1999 (i.e., July 10 or October 7)

Easter 1730

For example court records of an inheritance case may
state "Jill never married and his illegitimate issue will not get
anything" or "Robert was not born in Scotland so cannot inherit
the land in our kingdom". Also, if Jill is your aunt, you just know
she never married.

On 10th of october 1942, in Los Angeles,
    Charles West presented us their child. The mother is
    his wife Maggy East. Charles is born on the 1st of
    January 1920 in Salt Lake City, and now lives in San
    Francisco with his wife. He wishes to give the name
    of Jim to his newborn son.

Cousin John got
married last Sunday but we could not go to the wedding."
No mention of the bride's identity. We can, of course, project
our knowledge of "real reality" onto the past and create
an empty record for wife. But if we know from other evidence
that John had two (or more) wives and cannot relate the marriage
evidence to one of them with reasonable degree of certainty,
then the only choice is to place the data under INDI. Of course,
we can always place them in a NOTE - but we do not want that :-)
So, it is always the same old problem: one mother/two wives
or one marriage/two wives


you have primary records of John Doe being 31 in 1730, 41
in 1741, 43 in 1742, and 63 in 1764.  Your source would contain no
birthdates.
You could say that you have evidence of a birthdate of 1699, 1700, and
1701.  Your source has an age, which serves as evidence of an
approximate birthdate.
From that disparate evidence, you might draw a conclusion that he was
born about 1700

Joe did NOT have red hair, Jill was NEVER married, Robert was NOT born in Scotland.


in Quebec, there is a form filled
where there is a marriage, so for one marriage, you have the
church copy, the court house copy and the form (for statistical
purposes).  And since 1994, there is also a state copy in
duplicate (and no more court house copy, while churches can
have their own internal records).  


Rev. Adam White was celebrating the ceremony of John Smith's christening


John Smith was born on 12 October 1855 with red hair

One of the problems I have had is
recording information about where I've looked for a problem.  Example:
I'm looking for the death date of my ancestor Hiram Kirkpatrick.  The
sources that I have examined are: Probate files, headstone/cemetery
information, local family histories, pension files, church records.
All came up with no information.  How can I take this information with
me in my GEDCOM file?

says "X married Y on date D", and another
source says "Z was a witness at X's wedding" - these clearly must be
represented as two different wedding events

he was born in Boston" - we have no way of knowing which
Boston it 


my examples
-----------

an index that lists just a person's name: "Smith, John" (no event?)
two sources with dif info about one event "b: May" & "b: 1900"
persona's role in an event
characteristic (also an event?)
relation between two events "John is older than Mary" (John's birth < Mary's birth)
John was born near Cucklington
a photograph of an old family residence
tombstone
census
birth cert.
death cert.
marriage cert.
land record

ASSERTIONS
------------------------------------------------------
Let us say that we have a record of the marriage of two individuals, in a
family bible, and the will of an individual of the same name as the groom of
the wedding records, from the same locality, which names a wife with the
same given name as the bride, and lists a number of names of children, and
carries a date an appropriate time span later than the marriage record.  We
ASSERT that the bride and groom of the marriage record are the same as the
parents of the family in the will, creating two higher-level PERSONAE.  Now,
how can we test this ASSERTION?  If we find a will of a person whom we
identify with the owner of the family bible, we have a potential test.
Suppose the testator mentions his son and his son's wife, and their
children, his grandchildren.  Now suppose that the list of grandchildren is
completely different from the list of children in the first will.  We have
just disproved our ASSERTION.
