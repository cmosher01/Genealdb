From a source, we extract many hypotheses. A hypothesis is a
statement of genealogical information about a persona, an event,
a relation between them, or a persona's attribute. Several hypotheses
may refer to the same one persona, event, or relation.
Since the research project one is engaged in my itself during
the creation of this database may itself be referenced by another
genealogist in the future, thereby making this database a
"source" for that other genealogist; we store our own
hypotheses (derived from both the research we do and from our
own logical guesswork) in the same hypotheses table, and we
link those records to a source record that indicates the
research project we are engaged in.

A persona_rel record will relate two persona.

(equavalent to source 0:n-to-0:n source)
A way of grouping together various source items.

an hypothesis can lead to searches: a way to indicate searches to be performed
based on hypotheses
searches are done (or to be done) in sources
