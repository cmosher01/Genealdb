Places

Goals: be able to answer these questions:

1.  What place? (Identity)
    Simple name/phrase:
        "Hong Kong"
        "Machu Picchu"
        "The Isle of Man"
        "The Geographic South Pole"
    Names/phrases needing disambiguation:
        "Portland (the city in Maine in the United States of America)"
        "New York (the county, coextensive with the borough of Manhattan,
            in the United States of America"
        "San Jos√© (the municipality in the province of Romblon in the Philippines)"

2.  Where is it? (Location)
    Where would I go if I wanted to see it (the house, or property,
    or something similar).
    For genealogical purposes, the goal would usually be to find
    the smallest region possible, ultimately a single point identified
    by latitude/longitude coordinates.
    It is unlikely that a large region (for example "Europe") would be
    an ultimate goal for genealogical purposes; rather, the genealogist
    is interested in "some place within Europe", with the understanding
    that a more precise location is as yet unknown, and further research
    would be necessary to arrive at the smallest region applicable to
    a particular event.

3.  What governmental body had jurisdiction? (Administration)
    For genealogists, this would be where to search for official records of events
    that took place in the region. This is related to the question of what
    "type" of place is it, a town, a county, a city?"

4.  When? (Temporality)
    The time span of all names, locations, governments, etc., is relevant for genealogists.
    For example, "Given the date of 1630, which government(s) would have had jurisdiction
    over"

5.  From traditional genealogy point of view, given a date and a pointer to the
    most precise entity (geographical region/point) from the database, what are:
    a. location and address;
    b. the current name and jurisdictions of the place; and
    c. the contemporary name and jurisdictions of the place.
    Of these, the location and contemporary jurisdictions are of highest importance.
    Note, if the given region is large enough (e.g., "somewhere in Earlville Village"),
    the response may encompass multiple jurisdictions (two towns, two counties).

6.  Other.
    Disputed claims: more than one governmental body may have disputed claims
        to a particular place. Genealogists might want to search both places for
        records regarding events in the area.
    Places don't (necessarily) fall into a simple hierarchy:
        Earlville, a single village in New York, USA, lies in two
        different counties, Madison and Chenango. New York City contains
        5 counties. Virginia has cities that aren't in any county.
    Differentiate between location and jurisdiction. For example, Roanoke Colony
        existed on "Roanoke Island", 1585-1590, which has no relation to later
        settlements by Virginians, even though both occupied
        the same physical location named "Roanoke Island".
    Genealogists may need to refer to other features, such as rivers
        ("it happened on the James River") or the sea ("died at sea"),
        but this is a rare occurrence.
    Mistakes: recently, the Town of Easton Connecticut discovered a mistake
        in the official land records that was a hundred years old, with the
        effect that 3 houses that were thought to be in Easton for all those
        years actually were not.
    Streets and addresses help with identification and location.


The primary (genealogical) goal of "place" is determining the point (or smallest region) of a event,
relating to a person or (small) group of people who played roles in that event. Every data
structure or algorithm should be to help achieve this goal, directly or indirectly.

Secondary (genealogical) goals of "place" include determining the jurisdiction
(over a geographical point/region) in order to help locate official records of
the jurisdiction in charge.


separating out the types of data related to places:

1. Political
2. Civil
3. Geographical

Political:
Entity that creates and maintains official records for a given geographical region,
which region may change over time.
Examples: towns, villages, counties, colonies, countries, empires,
"common heritage of humanity".
A typical entity will have a name, which is only important to aid in its identification
Although the name may change over time, tracking name changes of an individual entity is
not a goal.
Entities typically have superior and inferior relations with other entities, but
in a graph, not necessarily in a hierarchy. Entities will typically have morphological
relationships with other entities, of these types: transformation, merge, split,
extraction, subsumption. And they will have a creation and possibly a destruction.
Consider tracking time only in years. It would be much easier to model. The reasoning is
that for political entities, events in the official records could extend beyond the
official start/end day of the entity. It may be of interest for historical reasons to
note the specific day, but for genealogical purposes, the year only might be enough.
Geographical boundaries should be realistic, not necessarily pedantic; for example
the 1620 Charter of New England claimed lands from "sea to sea", however it is unlikely
that any land west of, say, the Great Lakes would actually have had any events relating
to this claimed jurisdiction. So we should model a reasonable western boundary rather
than a theoretically accurate one.
GNIS class: "Civil"


Civil:
Large group of people taken as a set, inhabiting a given geographical region,
which region may change over time. Size-wise, a group would be a community, not a family.
Examples: "Mayflower Pilgrims", "Settlement at Roanoke", neighborhoods, CDPs, "Flatbush", communities
A civil entity might not have a name.
May have a name similar to the political entity that has jurisdiction over it.
May be contained entirely within a political entity, or multiple entities.
Or, may have no relation to the jurisdiction.
Civil entities can help in identifying political entities.
Civil entities can help with genealogical inductive reasoning about
individual members of the group.
An particular group can move across jurisdictions and locations over time, any yet still
maintain an identity of its own, for example Romani people.
Groups can have the same morphological changes as political entities.
???Given all that, civil groups should be considered entirely separate from the "place" concept.
GNIS class: "Populated Place"
Populace

Geographical:
Region (or point) on the 2-dimensional surface of the Earth.
Fixed in time; in order words, tracking changes in regions across time is
not a goal.
Its name is of limited importance, serving
mostly to maximize the precision of the location.
This could include postal addresses, streets, or other means of identifying a location
(e.g., ZIP code boundaries).
Includes metes and bounds or other land descriptions.
As regions change over time, it's probably easiest to map each region as a complete
region, rather than map a region plus a delta region.





Fundamental data representation


PoliticalDivision/CivilEntity node with properties:

(:PoliticalDivision {name})
(:Populace {name})
(:Morph {year})

Entity (Political or Civil) changes over time:

(x:PoliticalDivision)<-[:FROM]-(:Morph{year})-[:TO]->(y:PoliticalDivision)

Arity of From and To per Morph:

Fx Ty  name              notes
-----------------------------------
 0  N  multi-creation
 0  1  creation          case of 0 N
 0  0  no change         N/A
 1  0  destruction       case of N 0
 N  0  multi-destruction

 1  N  split             x==y => extraction
 1  1  transform         x==y => no change
 N  1  merger            x==y => subsumption

 N  N  multi-transform?  N/A?



Entity superiority

(:Place)
(:Transference {year})
[:OF] [:FROM] [:TO]
OF: the inferior entity(ies)
FROM: the old superior entity(ies)
TO: the new superior entity(ies)

(x:Place)<-[:OF]-(:Transference)-[:FROM]->(yo:Place)
                 (:Transference)-[:TO]->(yn:Place)

Arity per Transference:
Ox Fy Ty
N  0  N gaining superior(s)
N  N  0 losing superior(s)
N  N  N both
N  0  0 N/A

(:GeographicalRegion {name, region})

[:REGION {startYear}]

(:PoliticalDivision)-[:REGION]->(:GeographicalRegion)

(:Populace)-[:REGION]->(:GeographicalRegion)


Possibility: Combine PoliticalDivision and Populace into one class "Place" with a type, similar to GNIS database.

US Census Tiger files have "places" that are either incorporated (political entities) or not (census designated places).





===============================================================================
Use GIS system (QGIS, PostGIS, PostgreSQL) for geographical regions.

(:Transfer {year, notes, cite})
(:Transform {year, notes, cite})
(:Place {name, region, notes, etc.})  <-- region is a URL into the GIS system

[:OF]
[:FROM]
[:TO]



(x:Place)<-[:OF]-(:Transfer)-[:FROM]->(yOld:Place)
                 (:Transfer)-[:TO]->(yNew:Place)

(x:Place)<-[:FROM]-(:Transform)-[:TO]->(y:Place)
